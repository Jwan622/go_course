- go is a compiled language
- you can do string assigment like `var cards string = "Ace of Spades`
- Java, Go, C++ are static typed langauges. We do care about values assigned to variables.

- you can also just write `card := "Ace of spades"`. Equivalent to above syntax. specifically for strings. Go 
  compiled will figure it out. `:=` tells compiled to figure out the type.
- When reassigning to a string, you don't need to do `:=` again.
